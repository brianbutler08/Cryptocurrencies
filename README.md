# Cryptocurrencies

# Project Overview

For this project, we utilized unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze a set of cryptocurrency data and summarize our findings. The resulting analysis could be used by an investment bank to propose a new cryptocurrency portfolio to its clients.

The primary steps that we took for this analysis included:

- Preprocessing the dataset
- Reducing the data dimension using Principal Component Analysis
- Clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means
- Visualizing classification results with 2D and 3D scatter plots

# Results

## Clustering Cryptocurrencies using K-Means

In order to identify cryptocurrency clusters, we began by using the K-Means method to generate an elbow curve. The best k-value appears to be 4, leading us to proceed with our analysis with 4 clusters.

This 3-D scatter plot was obtained using the PCA algorithm to reduce the crytocurrencies dimensions to three principal components.
